## Description

This app will be forwarding messages from reddit to twitter. My VERY LAST effort here will be to add security, so make sure you don't expose anything and block your controllers.

Also, no tests for now, but we will see how it goes

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

```
